-RossMann Stores is Retail chain of drug stores operating in the Health and Beauty industry, that is projected to grow @2.6% every year. It is experiencing a 3% increase in Sales every year but a marked decline in Customer Walk-ins, owing to increasing competition. The goal of this project was to identify the internal and external factors impacting Sales and Customer walk-ins and develop a data driven approach to increase these numbers.

-Used Python to pre-process and uncover insights from a time series dataset with 1M datapoints

-Performed Exploratory data analysis by looking into seasonality, operationality, promotional strategies and Competition for 935 stores, split into 9 unique categories

- Used variables containing the stores’ operational days, promotional information, and impact of State holidays to create a Multiple Linear regression model to predict Monthly sales for the Stores.

-Sliced out stores that contribute to RossMann’ s negative customer growth and performed a competition distance-driven binning process on them. This resulted in the establishment of a positive correlation between the proximity of these stores to competition and their average sales.

-Created a new variable-Month since the inception of competition, by wrangling datetime stamps and found a positive correlation between the variable and average sales for the store categories returning negative customer growth.

-Identified store categories with high earning potential and recommended increased investment in these

-Identified days with high earning potential-like Sundays, State holidays and School Holidays and recommended that more stores are operational on these days , along with targeted promotions.
